          <h2>Hey there!</h2>
          <p style="text-align:left; margin:40px;">For years I have been thinking about starting my own blog. I started blogging around the age of 13 in secret
            because I felt a little embarrassed about sharing my little ideas and thoughts to this big world. Now after many
            years later, I finally have gathered the courage to share what is on my mind to people who might like the content of my page. 

            First, let me introduce myself. My name is Aya which means a verse or wonder in arabic. I really like the meaning of my name
            and also the fact that it only consists of three letters. I am currently 17 years old but on the 30th of January, I will 
            be officially 18 and considered an adult (I still cannot believe it.). I still go to school and I´m going to graduate this 
            year, which sadly means I won´t have that much of time for my blog. Nevertheless, I will always try to write here.
            <br>
            <br>
            For years writing has been one of my favorite things to do because with the help of simple words and senetences I can share my 
            complex thoughts with others. When I´m not online, I´m probably writing a short poem or even a whole novel. I also love 
            reading about anything, especially books about self-improvement (You can say that I´m clearly a book worm). 
            My current favorite book is atomic habits by James Clear which tells about the importance of habits and which I´m
            definitly going to talk about in one of my blogs. 
            So stay tuned!
